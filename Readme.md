As detailed in requirements.txt, this script relies on BeautifulSoup and
requests. I apparently forgot about Scrapy until after implementing
everything.

Command-line usage is fairly simple: just invoke as follows:

	python trawler.py ycombinator.com

(or any other valid url you can access via CURL)
